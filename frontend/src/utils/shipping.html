<p>
    · The Cabin Depot™ partners with reliable trucking companies across North America who specialize in LTL (Less Than
    Truckload) pallet or appliance delivery. Once your order leaves our dock, the trucking company assumes all responsibility
    for delivering your order as quickly as possible and without damage.
</p>
<p>· Delivery dates can vary depending on the trucking schedules available in your area.</p>
<p>· We carefully inspect all orders before they leave our warehouse to ensure they are accurate and in perfect condition.</p>
<p>· If you haven’t received a shipping e-mail confirmation with tracking and are curious about the status of your order,
    please let us know at any time. We can be reached via <span style="color: #0064a2">orders@thecabindepot.com</span> or call 1-844-603-4743 and select option
    #1. If we don’t answer, just leave a message, and we call you back ASAP.
</p>
<p>· When your order arrives, you must carefully inspect it immediately before the truck driver leaves or attempts to
    have you sign off on the paperwork. Paperwork is normally provided, and your signature is requested by the driver to
    acknowledge your order was delivered. If they have no paperwork for you to sign (usually a BOL or Freight Bill),
    you can request it. Some drivers will want to drop your order and leave asap as they have other deliveries to make.
    But remember, you paid to have them deliver your order in perfect condition, and they will wait for you to inspect it.
</p>
<p>If you sign the delivery paperwork without noting any discrepancies or damage, the freight company will not accept a
    claim and make the customer liable for any damage discovered.
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top:30px">INSPECTION INSTRUCTIONS:</div>
<p>1. Open all boxes & account for all items.</p>
<p>2. Ensure the items shipped are the correct model/type/colour.</p>
<p>3. If you ordered an appliance: you must remove the straps, lift the box, and look under the wrap to ensure no scratches
    or dents. Sometimes an appliance can be bumped or struck by a forklift without any visible damage to the packaging outside,
    so this is important!
</p>
<p>Please DO NOT sign the driver’s paperwork unless you are 100% certain the order is complete, there are no missing items,
    and it has arrived in perfect condition.
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top:30px">IF YOUR ORDER ARRIVES INCORRECT OR IS MISSING ITEMS:</div>
<p>Take pictures of the product as it was received! Note exactly what was shipped incorrect or missing on your paperwork.
    You need to clearly write this on the BOL or Freight Bill. Contact me and we’ll investigate and get this corrected for you asap!
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top:30px">IF YOUR ORDER ARRIVES DAMAGED:</div>
<p>As upsetting this may be, it does happen on occasion as careless drivers or warehouse workers may have mishandled your
    order. In this situation, you have 2 options:
</p>
<p>1. If there is significant damage to the order, you can refuse it. Note “ORDER REFUSED DUE TO DAMAGE” on the paperwork,
    and make sure you take plenty of pictures of the damage. Then email this information to us so I can follow up with the
    freight company. We can then either refund your order or ship a completely new order to you if the product is still
    in stock and available.
</p>
<p>2. If there’s only slight damage to your order, you can still choose to receive it. But note this damage clearly on the
    paperwork and take several pictures. Then send this information to us and we’ll follow up with the freight company. They
    would then be liable to provide parts to repair or send you some form of compensation.
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top:30px">IF YOU INSPECTED YOUR ORDER BUT LATER FOUND DAMAGE:</div>
<p>This is known as ‘concealed damage’ and freight companies only allow 24 hours to file a concealed damage claim. So, it is
    very important that if you start unpacking your order and discover damage to a part that wasn’t visible when you removed
    the packaging for initial inspection, you need to take pictures and contact us immediately. Do not wait. Freight companies
    will not even consider a concealed damage claim if one is filed more than 24 hours after receipt. Note that concealed
    damage claims are often denied, which is why your primary inspection as soon as the order arrives is so important.
</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; margin-top:30px">IF YOU ARE PICKING UP YOUR ORDER FROM A SHIPPING TERMINAL:</div>
<p>When you receive a phone call that your order is ready for pick-up at that selected shipping terminal, you have 24 hours
    to pick up your order. After 24 hours, a $35.00 plus tax charge will be applied. Please ensure that you follow the
    inspection instructions when picking up your order.
